description: This 1920 novel, a marvel of taut plotting, is regarded as among the
  finest spy stories of all time. Just before World War I, a dissolute English nobleman
  and a German secret agent, who happen to resemble each other exactly, meet by chance
  in South Africa. The German decides to take the Englishman's place and return to
  England in order to gain political power in conflict-filled Europe.
